# Weather-info

This is a  Weather Android application in Android Studio made using Java. The main goal of this project is to develop an android application for checking weather conditions at other places. This app retrieves real-time weather from API and shows it to user. I've used OpenWeatherMap API to get JSON data and Volley library is used in this app.
